# Ideal Gas Law Simulator

A 2D physics simulation built with Java and JavaFX that visualizes the Ideal Gas Law (PV = nRT) in real time.

## Features

### Gas Container Simulation
- Adjust pressure, volume, temperature, and number of particles using interactive sliders
- Watch particles move inside a container responding to variable changes
- Slidable lid that moves based on pressure changes
- Lid pops off when pressure exceeds the threshold

### Hot Air Balloon Mode
- Visualize how gas behavior affects a hot air balloon
- Adjust the same variables and watch the balloon rise or descend
- Demonstrates real-world application of the Ideal Gas Law

## Built With

- Java
- JavaFX
- Gradle

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- JDK 18 or higher
- Gradle (or use the included Gradle Wrapper)

### Running the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KyunSC/ideal-gas-law-simulator.git
